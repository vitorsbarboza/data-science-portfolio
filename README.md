# Data-Science-Portfolio

# Welcome to my data science portfolio!

Hello! My name is Vitor Barboza and I am a 23-year-old student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Physics Engineering at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar). Currently, I work as a Data Scientist Intern at Vivo Telefónica. My passion lies in machine learning, data science, statistics, and mathematics, and I am constantly working on projects in these areas. Explore them below!

## Projects

(Some projects are not finishied yet, I'm still working on them!)

## CLASSIFICATION

### [**Banking Customer Churn Prediction**](https://github.com/vitorsbarboza/Banking-Customer-Churn)
- **Description:** This is an end-to-end machine learning project (from data collection to deployment) that uses XGBoost to predict the probability of a customer canceling a bank's credit card service.
- **Business problem:** The bank manager is tired of seeing more and more customers stop using their banking products. He needs us to identify the probability of canceling the service for each customer, in order to rank them by cancellation chance and take possible actions from it, such as offering promotions. Identifying potential churners helps plan retention strategies, maintaining healthy revenue. Acquiring a new customer is more expensive than retaining an existing one.
- **Objectives:** Identify factors associated with customer churn; build a model capable of accurately predicting the probability of canceling the service for a customer; offer action plans for the bank to reduce credit card churn.

<!--  **Results:** It was possible to obtain an estimated gain of $171,477, by calculating the difference between the gain from true positives, the cost of retaining false positives, and the cost of false negatives canceling. Additionally, the model demonstrates incredible performance due to the quality of the data and the modeling carried out. -->
